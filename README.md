# My-Portfolio
In the environment, I place my previous project's pictures on the walls, And in one of the doors, I put a simple guess the word gameplay for entering.

After watching my introduction, the FPS gameplay starts, and you should protect yourself against some zombies.

I used multiple free assets for this project:
